# The Basics
Basically your most basic HTML File.
```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<!-- Stuff -->
</head>
<body>
	<!-- Stuff -->
</body>
</html>
```

Now, let's go throught the tags mentioned above (not sure why you would need this tho).

| Tag | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `<!doctype html>` | Defines the document type of the document. |
| `<html lang="en">` | Defines the language and root of the document. |
| `<head>` | Defines the head of the document. |
| `<body>` | Defines the body of the document. |

Also do note that you need a closing tag (e.g. `</tagname>`) for each opening tag.
